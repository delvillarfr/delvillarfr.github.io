        <p> <b>Job Market Paper:</b> Detection of Irregular Assignments of Cases to Judges </p>
        <p> Coming soon... </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;font-size:15px"> <b>Abstract:</b> I develop tools to detect irregular assignments of cases to judges and apply them to Ecuador's judicial system. I construct a database of over 2 million case assignments in Ecuador's district courts from 2016 to 2020 and I find that 80% of assignments that are inconsistent with existing regulations are accounted for by 7% of judges and 2% of courts. Overall, at least 2.9% of assignments are irregular. To obtain these quantities, I derive the sharp bounds on the overall, court-specific and judge-specific rates of irregular assignments, under two assumptions. First, I rely on <i>one-sided instruments</i>. These are variables that are excluded from one counterfactual outcome only: the assignment that would have been observed, had it been consistent with existing regulations. Second, I assume that the distribution of this counterfactual outcome is known. This assumption is stronger and yields informative lower bounds on the judge-specific probabilities that a case assignment is irregular. </p>
