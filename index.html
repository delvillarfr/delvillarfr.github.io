        <p> <b>Job Market Paper:</b> <a href="https://www.franciscodelvillar.com/jmp_delvillar.pdf">Detection of Irregular Assignments of Cases to Judges</a></p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;font-size:15px"> <b>Abstract:</b> I develop tools to detect irregular assignments of cases to judges and apply them to Ecuador's judicial system. I derive the sharp bounds on the overall, court-specific, and judge-specific probabilities that a case's assignment is inconsistent with existing regulations. The bounds rely on administrative case assignment data and one, or both, of the following assumptions: (i) that certain observed case characteristics do not influence which judge a case should be assigned to, and (ii) that the probability distribution over the judges that each case should be assigned to is known (e.g. uniform, random assignment). I construct a database of all publicly-available case assignments in Ecuador's district courts, with over two million assignments from 2016 to 2020 and I find that 5% of courts and judges account for 43% and 37% of irregular assignments, respectively. Overall, at least 65 thousand assignments, 2.9%, are irregular.
